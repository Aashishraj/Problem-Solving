Aashish Raj became the world best problem solver in year March 2021.  
I am Awesome.
I am the fastest human to think most efficient and correct solution of a problem.
Aashish Raj is the Sherlock Holmes of problem solving 
Aashish Raj is the best.

1. Introduction of the day:
  Today I gave enough rest to my mind as I slept for more than 10 hours and gave 4 hours to problem solving.

2. Problems solved:
  a. Consecutive XORS ( https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/D )
  
    Problem statement:
      An array is given having values in non-decreasing order, 
      do XOR operations on pair of the consequtive elements of the array so that it is no longer in non-decreasing order.
      The size of the array will decrease as we do more xor operations 
      as instead of two nos we are having one ie a xor b = c and c will be now the part of the array instead of a and b.
      Find the minimum no of xor operations needed to do it.
    
    Intutions and Ideas:
      1. If three consequtive nos are having same msb (1st bit from left when converted to binary) 
        then if we do xor of last two nos then it will be less than the first one.
        If it exists then the answer will be 1.
      2. if not 1 then we will apply brute force approach to find the answer, 
        let us assume that we find the answer from left segment ci and ci+1, i.e ci > ci+1 ,
        then for computing ci we needed some elements of the array aL,aL+1,......,am and
        for ci+1 the elements be: am+1,am+2,.......,ar;
        So we find that L,m,r which satisfy this and the 
        no of XOR operations= r-(m+1) + m- L = r - L - 1;  
    
    Code:

    Resloved errors:
      Minimum elements in ci can be 1 but I started calculating m from l+1 so according to this 2 elements was minimum.
      
    Doubts:
      How O(n^3) and O(n^4) solution is working as n is 1e5.
  
3. New Things learned:
  a. Considering the MSB for determining the xor results
  b. Learned how to use brute force ( I know it but this is different)
     i. First we find what is the result we need inorder to find the answer (like ci > ci+1)
     ii. we need to find that how those conditions can be achieved ( like how to compute ci and ci+1)
     iii. Now all possible combinations of step ii. to find the answer
     
4. Things to be more concerned about:
  a. Mathematical deduction of the problem
  b. Think Think

5. Improvements from yesterday:
  More focoused 
  Approach improved more mathematical now
